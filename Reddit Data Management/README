Both files will turn the mess of Reddit data into SQL databases in the format of Parent > Reply

DBRedditToTraining.py will turn these nifty new database files (put files in the list on line 4) into a to and from training set for tensorflow. Partents will be in from and replies (comments) will be in to. This will create a simulated conversation based on all the Reddit data you donwload.

Use this files and you'll either get a chat-bot that's really funny or really racist. You're using Reddit to train an AI are there really any other outcomes?
